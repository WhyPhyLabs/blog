title: Introducing WhyPhy Labs 
---
WhyPhy Labs is building AGI for a world of abundance. Our mission is to train world-class, open-source LLMs and serve them to the world, as we pursue AGI.

While we are not alone in the pursuit of AGI, our approach is shaped by a unique combination of priorities derived from our abundance mindset. Unlike our Western contemporaries, we are driven by an unwavering commitment to open-source, a single-minded developer focus, and an efficiency-first approach. As we usher in a new era of abundant intelligence, these priorities come together such that they uniquely benefit all stakeholders, from our customers to the Open Ecosystem and society more broadly.

Open-source AI is crucial to the future of technology and humanity, yet we find ourselves in a place where all four of the leading labs in the West have completely abandoned releasing their best models in the open, leaving Chinese labs as the schelling point for this critical technology. As a resolute member of the Open Ecosystem, WhyPhy is determined to turn the tide on this dynamic, committing to open-sourcing our models, data, and training code as we build towards open AGI for all.

Developers are our one and only customer. While various labs try to have their cake and eat it too, indecisive as to whether they are consumer-facing products or developer-focused platforms, WhyPhy suffers no such identity crisis. We are adamant believers that there is no constituency more consequential to creating a better future than builders, and we aim to empower them with the best AI on the market as they do so.

Our success is symbiotically interwoven with that of our customers. Because of this, it is critical that we provide them with unmatched value. In addition to the high quality bar of the models themselves, the lever we have to pull to ensure this is one of efficiency. We take an efficiency-first approach, optimizing throughout the entire stack from metal to model. In taking this approach, we create a win-win-win scenario that begins a virtuous cycle between us and our customers, and subsequently their customers, allowing the rising tide of abundant intelligence to lift all boats.

If you’re a builder, member of the Open Ecosystem, or just someone who shares our belief in an abundant, open future for AGI, <a href="https://whyphy.ai/contact">we’d love to hear from you</a> and learn how we can best build towards it together.
