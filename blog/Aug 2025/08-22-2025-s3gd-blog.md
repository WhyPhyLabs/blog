title: S3GD Optimizer Algorithm
---
We are excited to announce WhyPhy’s first open-source release, <a href="https://github.com/WhyPhyLabs/s3gd">S3GD</a>, a PyTorch-compatible, fused kernel implementation of the Smoothed SignSGD training optimizer. 

S3GD is <a href="https://leloykun.github.io/ponder/adam-aggressive-clipping/">nearly equivalent to Adam with aggressive gradient clipping</a>, as its <a href="https://x.com/kalomaze/status/1940424032119316813">sparse nature creates a similar Just Works effect</a> during post-training. Derived from the simpler SGD algorithm, Smoothed SignSGD is more computationally and memory efficient relative to Adam variants, pairing perfectly with its sparsity to make it a compelling candidate for both SFT and RFT. As post-training workloads and particularly reinforcement learning increase in prevalence, these efficiency gains accumulate to improve accessibility, benefiting the entirety of the Open Ecosystem. 

Working from a <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lion-pytorch">Triton implementation</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06675">Google’s Lion optimizer</a>, we 1) changed the raw gradient to sign(gradient), 2) adapted the step direction to the exponential moving average itself, and 3) eliminated the second β parameter, to make the conversion to Smoothed SignSGD. Given <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05967">Lion’s success in FP8 training</a> and the similarity of the algorithms, we further optimized S3GD, storing the momentum buffer in FP8 precision and casting the arithmetic to BF16, cutting state memory and bandwidth 4x while maintaining numerical robustness. 

S3GD is WhyPhy’s first contribution to the Open Ecosystem, with many more to come. You can find the production-ready implementation, open-sourced under the MIT License, in <a href="https://github.com/WhyPhyLabs/s3gd">our S3GD repository</a>.
